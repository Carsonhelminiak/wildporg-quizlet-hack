# wildporg Quizlet Hack

## What is it?
wildporg Quizlet Hack is a javascript/userscript program. It colors two matching quizlet cards the same color to assist learning.

## How do you install it?

There are two ways, using a chrome extension, and just using it in the browser. To use the chrome extension, continue reading. To use it with just a normal browser, go to the no extension page. ([./no-extension/](https://github.com/wildporg/wildporg-quizlet-hack/tree/main/no-extension))

It's pretty simple really, and there are 3 main steps.
- Install TamperMonkey (or any user script manager)
- Import the script
- Use it

Ok, here's that same thing but more in depth.

- Installing Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is easily installed by going to your extensions store e.g Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome, or Microsoft Web Store for Microsoft Edge (Chrome Web Store can also be used for Microsoft Edge).

Chrome:

```
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
```

Edge:
```
https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd?hl=zh-CN
```

Firefox:

```
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
```

- Importing the script

Once Tampermonkey is installed, click the extensions button in the top right of your browser (it may be somewhere else), then click Tampermonkey and after that dashboard. Now go to utilities, copy the script link from github and paste it in Import from url at the bottom. Click install, then install, and it should be finished!

- Using Quizlet Hack

Once Quizlet Hack is installed, it works automatically. When you go on quizlet match (only works on card drag mode) the two cards will become the same color. Any bugs or other issues please notify me here or email me at help@wildporg.com. Thanks for installing!
